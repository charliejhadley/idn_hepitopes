<p>Welcome to the HEPITOPES database.</p>

<p>This is intended to be a comprehensive listing of all known/putative HLA Class I epitopes in the hepatitis B virus. The initial content is based on a literature review conducted in January 2016.</p>

<p>We will update the database with new epitopes as they are identified. Please contact us if you have amendments to suggest, via the following link (link or directions to feedback form goes here).</p>

<p></p>

<p>The code for this interactive datatable is available on <a href='https://github.com/ox-it/Live-Data_Case-Studies/tree/gh-pages/2016/PhilippaMatthews'>Github</a>.</p>

# Hepitopes

Hepitopes is a project to collate all the existing HBV epitopes restricted by HLA Class I genes, and to develop this into a live on-line resource that can grow and develop over time.
 
The initial stage of this work has been to perform a literature search to identify all epitopes that have been published to date. We have undertaken a detailed review of all the references such that we can list epitope HLA-restrictions, locations in the HBV proteome, sequences and polymorphisms, and report preliminary data regarding the potential clinical significance of epitope-specific T cell immune responses.
 
Over time, this database will continue to be updated such that we can develop and maintain an open-access resource that is useful for basic research and clinical vaccine design. This will include new epitopes identified as a result of my own work in Hepatitis B immunogenetics, as well as continuing to identify and collate new epitopes published by other groups.
